<H2>QA KEYWORDS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>CVS/Entries.IO_error</B>

<DD>
While attempting to commit, a CVS/Entries directory wasn't found- either the cvs co is damaged, or permissions block repoman from reading the file.
<DT><B>digest.assumed</B>

<DD>
Files listed in the digest were not found in your $DISTDIR so the existing 
digest entries are assumed to be correct.
<DT><B>digest.disjointed</B>

<DD>
The digests were not added to cvs when the matching ebuild had already been 
added.
<DT><B>digest.missing</B>

<DD>
Ebuild files were found that do not have a corresponding digest.
<DT><B>digest.notadded</B>

<DD>
The digests were found but have not been added to cvs.
<DT><B>digest.stray</B>

<DD>
Digest files were found that do not have a corresponding ebuild.
<DT><B>ebuild.disjointed</B>

<DD>
The ebuilds were not added to cvs when the matching digest had already been 
added.
<DT><B>ebuild.invalidname</B>

<DD>
The ebuilds were found but have not been added to cvs.
<DT><B>file.executable</B>

The file has the executable bit set, when it's not needed- check is limited to ebuilds, digests, Manifest, ChangeLog, and metadata.xml.
<DT><B>file.size</B>

<DD>
The file's size exceeds 20k, current policy is no files over 20k in a packages files directory.
<DT><B>filedir.missing</B>

<DD>
The package lacks a files directory.
<DT><B>DEPEND.bad</B>

<DD>
User-visible ebuilds with bad DEPEND settings (matched against *visible* ebuilds).
In other words, user-visiable ebuilds could not be found to satisfy the DEPEND settings.
<DT><B>RDEPEND.bad</B>

<DD>
User-visible ebuilds with bad RDEPEND settings (matched against *visible* ebuilds).
In other words, user-visiable ebuilds could not be found to satisfy the RDEPEND settings.

<DD>
Masked ebuilds with bad DEPEND settings (matched against *all* ebuilds)
In other words, no ebuilds could not be found to satisfy the DEPEND settings.
<DT><B>RDEPEND.badmasked</B>

In other words, no ebuilds could not be found to satisfy the RDEPEND settings.

<DD>
An error occured while generating the cache entry.  This typically means the ebuild contains syntax error(s).
<DT><B>ebuild.output</B>

<DD>
A simple sourcing of the ebuild produces output.  This breaks ebuild policy.
<DT><B>IUSE.invalid</B>

<DD>
